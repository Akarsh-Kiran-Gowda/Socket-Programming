This C program implements a basic TCP echo server using the Berkeley sockets API that listens on port 3490, accepts a single client connection, prints any received message to the console, and echoes it back to the client before closing. To use it, simply compile the code with ``` gcc server.c -o server ```, start the listener by running ``` ./server ```, and then test it in a separate terminal window by connecting with nc localhost 3490 and typing a message.
